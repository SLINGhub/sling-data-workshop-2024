Study Title	LipidCreator workbench to probe the lipidomic landscape - Targeted lipidomics analysis of Human Plasma samples and comparison with NIST SRM 1950 standard
Study Description	<p>Here we present LipidCreator, a software that fully supports targeted lipidomics assay development. LipidCreator offers a comprehensive framework to compute MS/MS fragment masses for over 60 lipid classes. LipidCreator provides all functionalities needed to define fragments, manage stable isotope labeling, optimize collision energy and generate in silico spectral libraries. We validate LipidCreator assays computationally and analytically and prove that it is capable to generate large targeted experiments to analyze blood and to dissect lipid-signaling pathways such as in human platelets.</p><p><br></p><p>In MTBLS1375, to validate tissue-specific transitions which we generated with LipidCreator, we conducted quantitative lipidomics experiments monitoring 433 lipids in the plasma of 21 healthy Asian human subjects. For a subset of 50 individual lipid levels the concentrations were compared to a recently conducted ring trial monitoring the lipid content of a reference material obtained from a mixed American population (NIST SRM 1950). The rationale behind this was to see if the creation of a list including internal standard and endogenous lipids lead to similar quantitative results as the ring trial experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>Studies linked to this manuscript include;</p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1333' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1333; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Thermo QExactive HF</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1334' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1334; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Agilent QTof</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1369' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1369; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Phospho- and Glycerolipid Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1375' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1375; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of Human Plasma samples and comparison with NIST SRM 1950 standard</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1376' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1376; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of S. cerevisiae to determine true and false identification</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1381' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1381; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Lipid Mediator Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1382' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1382; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - DIA Lipid Mediator Validation</a></p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>Blood from 21 healthy individuals (12 males, 9 females; 22 - 44 years old) was obtained by venipuncture into K3EDTA BD Vacutainer tubes. Platelet poor plasma was collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 3,850 g (4 °C) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. The collection and use of human plasma samples has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Singapore (NUS-IRB N-17-082E and NUS-IRB B-15-094, Singapore).</p><p><br></p><p>Control samples were as follows;</p><p>The NIST Standard Reference Material for Human Plasma (SRM1950) was purchased from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).</p><p>Batched Process Quality Control (BQC) samples were generated by pooling equal volumes plasma samples, aliquoting and extracting together with study samples. </p><p>Technical QC (TQC) were re-aliquoted from pooled extracts of non-plasma samples and injected repeatedly.</p><p>Response QC samples (RQC) were prepared as a diluted sample series from the TQC samples to determine linear response.</p><p>Long Term Reference samples were also included to determine assay long-term stability and QC checks (not for quantification within this study).</p>	<p><br></p><p>Plasma lipids were extracted using a single-phase, butanol/methanol-based method [1]. For each plasma sample (including PQC), 15 µl sample was transferred to a 2&nbsp;ml Eppendorf tube. Subsequently, 150 µl of 1-butanol:methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 7.5 µl deuterated internal standard mix SPLASH(R) LIPIDOMIX(R) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, USA), 44 nmol/l ceramide d18:1/16:0-D31 (Avanti) and 100 nmol/l lactosylceramide d18:1/16:0-D3 (Matreya LCC, State College, PA, USA) was added. Tubes were vortexed for 30 sec and sonicated for 30&nbsp;min in an ultrasound water bath (20&nbsp;°C). After centrifugation (10 min, 14,000&nbsp;g, 4&nbsp;°C), the supernatant was transferred to polypropylene autosampler vials for subsequent LC-MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Alshehry, Z.H. et al.

Ion Funnel parameters: pos high pressure RF 180, pos low pressure RF 160. Data were acquired in positive mode using dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), monitoring 302 lipid species reported by Saw et al. [1] (total cycle time 800 ms). Each sample, maintained at 10°C in the autosampler, was measured in quadruplicates (injection volume 1 µl) within two distinct blocks (e.g. A 1,2 and B 1,2), interspersed with QC and blank QC samples.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Saw, W.Y. et al.

[1] were selected for quantification. Peak integration of MRM traces was done using Skyline. Each lipid species was manually validated for the correct annotation [2,3] and quantified when (i) the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than three, compared to lipid species signals in blank samples and (ii) the coefficient of variation of the species in the PQC samples was less than 20% [3]. The concentrations of the lipid species were calculated by relating the peak area of each lipid species to the peak area of the corresponding internal standard. Transition lists, integrated peak tables and the final absolute lipid quantities, together with an R script to create the MetaboLights maf metabolite tables, are provided in the project directory.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Bowden, J.A. et al.
